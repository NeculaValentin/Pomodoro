## The Best Pomodoro Timer
Pomodoro² is a pomodoro timer with one purpose: to help you stay focused on your work. With no ads and no distracting graphics, this gorgeous timer is a great way for you to concentrate on your work.

Pomodoro² is based on a time management technique that has been proven to increase productivity. There are 4 steps:
1. Work on a particular task of your choice for 25 minutes with no loss of focus.
2. End the work when the timer rings and take a 5 minute break.
3. Begin another work session, or pomodoro, for another 25 minutes.
4. After four pomodoros, take a 30 minute break, then go to step 1.

That's all!

By balancing your work-break time, you can improve your concentration and enhance your productivity. What's also cool is unlike other timers which can have loud alarms and bright visuals, Pomodoro² is developed to be as unobtrusive to your workflow as possible.

## Development
Pomodoro² was created as an internal tool, to help me manage my other development projects. Apart from this, I also decided to explore SwiftUI through this practical project. I've decided to open source this app so it can be further refined and improved in upcoming versions. 

If you want to explore SwiftUI by working on a project, you're more than welcome to try and tackle some of the features I'd love to see Pomodoro² have in the future.

### TODO
- [ ] Play alert when timer runs out
- [ ] Localization in Spanish, French, Mandarin, French, German, Italian, Russian, Portuguese, and many more...
- [ ] Users should choose length of Pomodoro (15-25 minutes) instead of just 25 minutes
- [ ] watchOS app
